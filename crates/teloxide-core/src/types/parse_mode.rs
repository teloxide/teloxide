/// Formatting options.
///
/// The Bot API supports basic formatting for messages. You can use bold,
/// italic, underlined, strikethrough, and spoiler text, as well as inline links
/// and pre-formatted code in your bots' messages. Telegram clients will render
/// them accordingly. You can use either markdown-style or HTML-style
/// formatting.
///
/// Note that Telegram clients will display an **alert** to the user before
/// opening an inline link ('Open this link?' together with the full URL).
///
/// Message entities can be nested, providing following restrictions are met:
/// - If two entities have common characters then one of them is fully contained
///   inside another.
/// - bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, and spoiler entities can contain
///   and can be part of any other entities, except pre and code.
/// - All other entities can't contain each other.
///
/// Links `tg://user?id=<user_id>` can be used to mention a user by their ID
/// without using a username. Please note:
///
/// - These links will work **only** if they are used inside an inline link. For
///   example, they will not work, when used in an inline keyboard button or in
///   a message text.
/// - These mentions are only guaranteed to work if the user has contacted the
///   bot in the past, has sent a callback query to the bot via inline button or
///   is a member in the group where he was mentioned.
///
/// ## MarkdownV2 style
///
/// To use this mode, pass [`MarkdownV2`] in the `parse_mode` field.
/// Use the following syntax in your message:
/// ````text
/// *bold \*text*
/// _italic \*text_
/// __underline__
/// ~strikethrough~
/// ||spoiler||
/// *bold _italic bold ~italic bold strikethrough ||italic bold strikethrough spoiler||~ __underline italic bold___ bold*
/// [inline URL](http://www.example.com/)
/// [inline mention of a user](tg://user?id=123456789)
/// ![üëç](tg://emoji?id=5368324170671202286)
/// `inline fixed-width code`
/// ```
/// pre-formatted fixed-width code block
/// ```
/// ```rust
#[doc = "pre-formatted fixed-width code block written in the Rust programming language"]
/// ```
/// >Block quotation started
/// >Block quotation continued
/// >Block quotation continued
/// >Block quotation continued
/// >The last line of the block quotation
/// **>The expandable block quotation started right after the previous block quotation
/// >It is separated from the previous block quotation by an empty bold entity
/// >Expandable block quotation continued
/// >Hidden by default part of the expandable block quotation started
/// >Expandable block quotation continued
/// >The last line of the expandable block quotation with the expandability mark||
/// ````
///
/// Please note:
/// - Any character between 1 and 126 inclusively can be escaped anywhere with a
///   preceding '\' character, in which case it is treated as an ordinary
///   character and not a part of the markup.
/// - Inside `pre` and `code` entities, all '`‚Äò and ‚Äô\‚Äò characters must be
///   escaped with a preceding ‚Äô\' character.
/// - Inside `(...)` part of inline link definition, all ')‚Äò and ‚Äô\‚Äò must be
///   escaped with a preceding ‚Äô\' character.
/// - In all other places characters ‚Äô_‚Äò, ‚Äô*‚Äò, ‚Äô[‚Äò, ‚Äô]‚Äò, ‚Äô(‚Äò, ‚Äô)‚Äò, ‚Äô~‚Äò, ‚Äô`‚Äò,
///   ‚Äô>‚Äò, ‚Äô#‚Äò, ‚Äô+‚Äò, ‚Äô+‚Äò, ‚Äô-‚Äò, ‚Äô|‚Äò, ‚Äô{‚Äò, ‚Äô}‚Äò, ‚Äô.‚Äò, ‚Äô!‚Äò must be escaped with the
///   preceding character ‚Äô\'.
/// - In case of ambiguity between `italic` and `underline` entities ‚Äò__‚Äô is
///   always greadily treated from left to right as beginning or end of
///   `underline` entity, so instead of `___italic underline___` use `___italic
///   underline_\r__`, where `\r` is a character with code `13`, which will be
///   ignored.
/// - A valid emoji must be provided as an alternative value for the custom
///   emoji. The emoji will be shown instead of the custom emoji in places where
///   a custom emoji cannot be displayed (e.g., system notifications) or if the
///   message is forwarded by a non-premium user. It is recommended to use the
///   emoji from the emoji field of the custom emoji [sticker](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#sticker).
/// - Custom emoji entities can only be used by bots that purchased additional usernames on [Fragment](https://fragment.com/).
///
/// ## HTML style
///
/// To use this mode, pass [`Html`] in the `parse_mode` field.
/// The following tags are currently supported:
/// ````text
/// <b>bold</b>, <strong>bold</strong>
/// <i>italic</i>, <em>italic</em>
/// <u>underline</u>, <ins>underline</ins>
/// <s>strikethrough</s>, <strike>strikethrough</strike>, <del>strikethrough</del>
/// <span class="tg-spoiler">spoiler</span>, <tg-spoiler>spoiler</tg-spoiler>
/// <b>bold <i>italic bold <s>italic bold strikethrough <span class="tg-spoiler">italic bold strikethrough spoiler</span></s> <u>underline italic bold</u></i> bold</b>
/// <a href="http://www.example.com/">inline URL</a>
/// <a href="tg://user?id=123456789">inline mention of a user</a>
/// <tg-emoji emoji-id="5368324170671202286">üëç</tg-emoji>
/// <code>inline fixed-width code</code>
/// <pre>pre-formatted fixed-width code block</pre>
#[doc = "<pre><code class=\"language-rust\">pre-formatted fixed-width code block written in the \
         Rust programming language</code></pre>"]
/// <blockquote>Block quotation started\nBlock quotation continued\nThe last
/// line of the block quotation</blockquote>
/// <blockquote expandable>Expandable block quotation started\nExpandable block
/// quotation continued\nExpandable block quotation continued\nHidden by default
/// part of the block quotation started\nExpandable block quotation
/// continued\nThe last line of the block quotation</blockquote>
/// ````
/// 
/// Please note:
///
/// - Only the tags mentioned above are currently supported.
/// - All `<`, `>` and `&` symbols that are not a part of a tag or an HTML
///   entity must be replaced with the corresponding HTML entities (`<` with
///   `&lt;`, `>` with `&gt;` and `&` with `&amp;`).
/// - All numerical HTML entities are supported.
/// - The API currently supports only the following named HTML entities: `&lt;`,
///   `&gt;`, `&amp;` and `&quot;`.
/// - Use nested `pre` and `code` tags, to define programming language for `pre`
///   entity.
/// - Programming language can't be specified for standalone `code` tags.
/// - A valid emoji must be used as the content of the `tg-emoji` tag. The emoji will be shown instead of the custom emoji in places where a custom emoji cannot be displayed (e.g., system notifications) or if the message is forwarded by a non-premium user. It is recommended to use the emoji from the emoji field of the custom emoji [sticker](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#sticker).
/// - Custom emoji entities can only be used by bots that purchased additional usernames on [Fragment](https://fragment.com/).
///
/// ## Markdown style
///
/// This is a legacy mode, retained for backward compatibility. To use this
/// mode, pass [`Markdown`] in the `parse_mode` field.
/// Use the following syntax in your message:
/// ````text
/// *bold text*
/// _italic text_
/// [inline URL](http://www.example.com/)
/// [inline mention of a user](tg://user?id=123456789)
/// `inline fixed-width code`
/// ```
/// pre-formatted fixed-width code block
/// ```
/// ```rust
/// pre-formatted fixed-width code block written in the Rust programming language
/// ```
/// ````
/// 
/// Please note:
/// - Entities must not be nested, use parse mode [`MarkdownV2`] instead.
/// - There is no way to specify underline and strikethrough entities, use parse
///   mode [`MarkdownV2`] instead.
/// - To escape characters ‚Äô_‚Äò, ‚Äô*‚Äò, ‚Äô`‚Äò, ‚Äô[‚Äò outside of an entity, prepend the
///   characters ‚Äô\' before them.
/// - Escaping inside entities is not allowed, so entity must be closed first
///   and reopened again: use `_snake_\__case_` for italic `snake_case` and
///   `*2*\**2=4*` for bold `2*2=4`.
