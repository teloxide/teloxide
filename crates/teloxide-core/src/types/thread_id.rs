/// Reply thread identifier.
///
/// A message that isn't a reply and other messages that reply to it directly or
/// indirectly through a reply chain constitute a reply thread. All messages
/// except the initial root message have an additional [`thread_id`] field that
/// is equal to the root message's id.
///
/// In other words a thread id can be found recursively following
/// `reply_to_message_id`, until you find a message which does not reply to
/// anything, it's id is the thread id.
///
/// For example:
///
/// ```text
/// lizard: Hi {id:17} <-------------+--------------+----+--------------+---------------------+
///                                  |              |    |              |                     |
